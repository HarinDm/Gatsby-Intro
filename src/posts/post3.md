# Немецкие Автомобили

**Configuring the tableOfContents**, By default, absolute is set to false, generating a relative path. If you’d like to generate an absolute path, pass absolute: true. In that case, be sure to pass the pathToSlugField parameter, often fields.slug, to create absolute URLs. Note that providing a non-existent field will cause the result to be null. To alter the default values for tableOfContents generation, include values for heading (string) and/or maxDepth (number 1 to 6) in GraphQL query. If a value for heading is given, the first heading that matches will be omitted and the ToC is generated from the next heading of the same depth onwards. Value for maxDepth sets the maximum depth of the toc (i.e. if a maxDepth of 3 is set, only h1 to h3 headings will appear in the toc).
